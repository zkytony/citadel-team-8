          <h1>Non-technical executive summary</h1>
          <p>
            The June 23, 2019 Brexit referendum in which the UK voted, by a narrow margin, to leave the EU,
            was not only a surprise, roiling the London Stock Exchange, but also presented the prospect of major change
            to the dynamics of the UK markets and social factors, including employment and immigration.
            How significant were these changes? Can we detect such a fundamental shift from data on the stock market,
            employment, and immigration alone?

            We addressed these questions with a changepoint model, which hypothesizes that there is some point in time
            at which the dynamics of these fundamental economic indicators changed, whereas the indicators tend to be constant
            between changepoints. We found that the changepoint model indeed finds a striking change in roughly August 2019.
          </p>

          <h1>Technical exposition</h1>
          <p>
            When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
            $$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
